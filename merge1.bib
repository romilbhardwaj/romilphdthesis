		  shift from monolithic applications, to graphs of hundreds
		  or thousands of loosely-coupled microservices.
		  Microservices fundamentally change a lot of assumptions
		  current cloud systems are designed with, and present both
		  opportunities and challenges when optimizing for quality of
		  service (QoS) and cloud utilization.In this paper we
		  explore the implications microservices have across the
		  cloud system stack. We first present DeathStarBench, a
		  novel, open-source benchmark suite built with microservices
		  that is representative of large end-to-end services,
		  modular and extensible. DeathStarBench includes a social
		  network, a media service, an e-commerce site, a banking
		  system, and IoT applications for coordination control of
		  UAV swarms. We then use DeathStarBench to study the
		  architectural characteristics of microservices, their
		  implications in networking and operating systems, their
		  challenges with respect to cluster management, and their
		  trade-offs in terms of application design and programming
		  frameworks. Finally, we explore the tail at scale effects
		  of microservices in real deployments with hundreds of
		  users, and highlight the increased pressure they put on
		  performance predictability.},

		  deployment of machine learning, genomics and scientific
		  workloads on cloud computing infrastructure. However,
		  efficiently running these applications on shared
		  infrastructure is challenging and we find that choosing the
		  right hardware configuration can significantly improve
		  performance and cost. The key to address the above
		  challenge is having the ability to predict performance of
		  applications under various resource configurations so that
		  we can automatically choose the optimal configuration.Our
		  insight is that a number of jobs have predictable structure
		  in terms of computation and communication. Thus we can
		  build performance models based on the behavior of the job
		  on small samples of data and then predict its performance
		  on larger datasets and cluster sizes. To minimize the time
		  and resources spent in building a model, we use optimal
		  experiment design, a statistical technique that allows us
		  to collect as few training points as required. We have
		  built Ernest, a performance prediction framework for large
		  scale analytics and our evaluation on Amazon EC2 using
		  several workloads shows that our prediction error is low
		  while having a training overhead of less than 5% for
		  long-running jobs.},

  abstract	= {Deep learning workloads are common in today's production
		  clusters due to the proliferation of deep learning driven
		  AI services (e.g., speech recognition, machine
		  translation). A deep learning training job is
		  resource-intensive and time-consuming. Efficient resource
		  scheduling is the key to the maximal performance of a deep
		  learning cluster. Existing cluster schedulers are largely
		  not tailored to deep learning jobs, and typically
		  specifying a fixed amount of resources for each job,
		  prohibiting high resource efficiency and job performance.
		  This paper proposes Optimus, a customized job scheduler for
		  deep learning clusters, which minimizes job training time
		  based on online resource-performance models. Optimus uses
		  online fitting to predict model convergence during
		  training, and sets up performance models to accurately
		  estimate training speed as a function of allocated
		  resources in each job. Based on the models, a simple yet
		  effective method is designed and used for dynamically
		  allocating resources and placing deep learning tasks to
		  minimize job completion time. We implement Optimus on top
		  of Kubernetes, a cluster manager for container
		  orchestration, and experiment on a deep learning cluster
		  with 7 CPU servers and 6 GPU servers, running 9 training
		  jobs using the MXNet framework. Results show that Optimus
		  outperforms representative cluster schedulers by about 139%
		  and 63% in terms of job completion time and makespan,
		  respectively.},

		  jointly optimizes neural network weights and
		  hyperparameters which periodically copies weights of the
		  best performers and mutates hyperparameters during
		  training. Previous PBT implementations have been
		  synchronized glass-box systems. We propose a general,
		  black-box PBT framework that distributes many asynchronous
		  "trials" (a small number of training steps with
		  warm-starting) across a cluster, coordinated by the PBT
		  controller. The black-box design does not make assumptions
		  on model architectures, loss functions or training
		  procedures. Our system supports dynamic hyperparameter
		  schedules to optimize both differentiable and
		  non-differentiable metrics. We apply our system to train a
		  state-of-the-art WaveNet generative model for human voice
		  synthesis. We show that our PBT system achieves better
		  accuracy and faster convergence compared to existing
		  methods, given the same computational resource.},

		  tasks to commodity databases across workloads in response
		  to peak loads or failure conditions thus providing quality

		  investigate our transparent provisioning mechanisms in the

		  resource requirements, along CPU, memory, disk and network.
		  Any of these resources may become bottlenecks and hence,
		  the likelihood of wasting resources due to fragmentation is

		  fragmentation. Worse, since they only allocate cores and
		  memory, the resources that they ignore (disk and network)
		  can be over-allocated leading to interference, failures and
		  hogging of cores or memory that could have been used by
		  other tasks. We present Tetris, a cluster scheduler that
		  packs, i.e., matches multi-resource task requirements with
		  resource availabilities of machines so as to increase
		  cluster efficiency (makespan). Further, Tetris uses an
		  analog of shortest-running-time-first to trade-off cluster
		  efficiency for speeding up individual jobs. Tetris' packing
		  heuristics seamlessly work alongside a large class of
		  fairness policies. Trace-driven simulations and deployment
		  of our prototype on a 250 node cluster shows median gains

		  Recognizing a paradigm shift in the industry the
		  Transaction Processing Performance Council has developed a
		  new Decision Support benchmark, TPC-DS, expected to be
		  released this year. From an ease of benchmarking
		  perspective it is similar to past benchmarks. However, it
		  adjusts for new technology and new approaches the industry
		  has embarked on in recent years. This paper describes the
		  main characteristics of TPC-DS, explains why some of the
		  key decisions were made and which performance aspects of
		  decision support system it measures.},

		  is used to optimize many of our machine learning models and
		  other systems, and also provides core capabilities to
		  Google's Cloud Machine Learning HyperTune subsystem. We
		  discuss our requirements, infrastructure design, underlying
		  algorithms, and advanced features such as transfer learning
