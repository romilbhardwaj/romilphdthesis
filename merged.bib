abstract = {The next generation of AI applications will continuously interact with the environment and learn from these interactions. These applications impose new and demanding systems requirements, both in terms of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we consider these requirements and present Ray--a distributed system to address them. Ray implements a unified interface that can express both task-parallel and actor-based computations, supported by a single dynamic execution engine. To meet the performance requirements, Ray employs a distributed scheduler and a distributed and fault-tolerant store to manage the system's control state. In our experiments, we demonstrate scaling beyond 1.8 million tasks per second and better performance than existing specialized systems for several challenging reinforcement learning applications.},

abstract = {Any sufficiently complex system acts as a black box when it becomes easier to experiment with than to understand. Hence, black-box optimization has become increasingly important as systems have become more complex. In this paper we describe Google Vizier, a Google-internal service for performing black-box optimization that has become the de facto parameter tuning engine at Google. Google Vizier is used to optimize many of our machine learning models and other systems, and also provides core capabilities to Google's Cloud Machine Learning HyperTune subsystem. We discuss our requirements, infrastructure design, underlying algorithms, and advanced features such as transfer learning and automated early stopping that the service provides.},

abstract = {Performance of machine learning algorithms depends critically on identifying a good set of hyperparameters. While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration nonstochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},

abstract = {Recent workload trends indicate rapid growth in the deployment of machine learning, genomics and scientific workloads on cloud computing infrastructure. However, efficiently running these applications on shared infrastructure is challenging and we find that choosing the right hardware configuration can significantly improve performance and cost. The key to address the above challenge is having the ability to predict performance of applications under various resource configurations so that we can automatically choose the optimal configuration.Our insight is that a number of jobs have predictable structure in terms of computation and communication. Thus we can build performance models based on the behavior of the job on small samples of data and then predict its performance on larger datasets and cluster sizes. To minimize the time and resources spent in building a model, we use optimal experiment design, a statistical technique that allows us to collect as few training points as required. We have built Ernest, a performance prediction framework for large scale analytics and our evaluation on Amazon EC2 using several workloads shows that our prediction error is low while having a training overhead of less than 5% for long-running jobs.},

abstract = {Population Based Training (PBT) is a recent approach that jointly optimizes neural network weights and hyperparameters which periodically copies weights of the best performers and mutates hyperparameters during training. Previous PBT implementations have been synchronized glass-box systems. We propose a general, black-box PBT framework that distributes many asynchronous "trials" (a small number of training steps with warm-starting) across a cluster, coordinated by the PBT controller. The black-box design does not make assumptions on model architectures, loss functions or training procedures. Our system supports dynamic hyperparameter schedules to optimize both differentiable and non-differentiable metrics. We apply our system to train a state-of-the-art WaveNet generative model for human voice synthesis. We show that our PBT system achieves better accuracy and faster convergence compared to existing methods, given the same computational resource.},

Recognizing a paradigm shift in the industry the Transaction Processing Performance Council has developed a new Decision Support benchmark, TPC-DS, expected to be released this year. From an ease of benchmarking perspective it is similar to past benchmarks. However, it adjusts for new technology and new approaches the industry has embarked on in recent years. This paper describes the main characteristics of TPC-DS, explains why some of the key decisions were made and which performance aspects of decision support system it measures.},

and larger degrees of parallelism to provide low latency. Scheduling highly parallel
jobs that complete in hundreds of milliseconds poses a major challenge for task schedulers,
which will need to schedule millions of tasks per second on appropriate machines while
offering millisecond-level latency and high availability. We demonstrate that a decentralized,
randomized sampling approach provides near-optimal performance while avoiding the
throughput and availability limitations of a centralized design. We implement and
deploy our scheduler, Sparrow, on a 110-machine cluster and demonstrate that Sparrow
performs within 12% of an ideal scheduler.},

  abstract  = {Cloud services have recently started undergoing a major shift from monolithic applications,
to graphs of hundreds or thousands of loosely-coupled microservices. Microservices
fundamentally change a lot of assumptions current cloud systems are designed with,
and present both opportunities and challenges when optimizing for quality of service
(QoS) and cloud utilization.In this paper we explore the implications microservices
have across the cloud system stack. We first present DeathStarBench, a novel, open-source
benchmark suite built with microservices that is representative of large end-to-end
services, modular and extensible. DeathStarBench includes a social network, a media
service, an e-commerce site, a banking system, and IoT applications for coordination
control of UAV swarms. We then use DeathStarBench to study the architectural characteristics
of microservices, their implications in networking and operating systems, their challenges
with respect to cluster management, and their trade-offs in terms of application design
and programming frameworks. Finally, we explore the tail at scale effects of microservices
in real deployments with hundreds of users, and highlight the increased pressure they
put on performance predictability.},

  abstract  = {To better understand the challenges in developing effective cloud-based resource schedulers, we analyze the first publicly available trace data from a sizable multi-purpose cluster. The most notable workload characteristic is heterogeneity: in resource types (e.g., cores:RAM per machine) and their usage (e.g., duration and resources needed). Such heterogeneity reduces the effectiveness of traditional slot- and core-based scheduling. Furthermore, some tasks are constrained as to the kind of machine types they can use, increasing the complexity of resource assignment and complicating task migration. The workload is also highly dynamic, varying over time and most workload features, and is driven by many short jobs that demand quick scheduling decisions. While few simplifying assumptions apply, we find that many longer-running jobs have relatively stable resource utilizations, which can help adaptive resource schedulers.},

We prove this using a discrete-time model of a single resource, shared among a number of users with heterogeneous Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) controls. AIMD has been implemented in the congestion avoidance mechanism of Internet's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and beyond its simplicity it has been proved extremely efficient and robust. We show how AIMD can be parametrized in order to allow the scaling of user allocations according to a given set of weights. We also analyze the effects of different parameter choices on the performance and the oscillating behaviour of the system. Our analysis is supported by simulations and the results provide useful insights to the performance and the properties of distributed resource sharing.},

  abstract     = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets that is amenable to a broad variety of real-world tasks. Users specify the computation in terms of a map and a reduce function, and the underlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the computation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles machine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks. Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.},

  abstract  = {We present Henge, a system to support intent-based multi-tenancy in modern distributed stream processing systems. Henge supports multi-tenancy as a first-class citizen: everyone in an organization can now submit their stream processing jobs to a single, shared, consolidated cluster. Secondly, Henge allows each job to specify its own intents (i.e., requirements) as a Service Level Objective (SLO) that captures latency and/or throughput needs. In such an intent-driven multi-tenant cluster, the Henge scheduler adapts continually to meet jobs' respective SLOs in spite of limited cluster resources, and under dynamically varying workloads. SLOs are soft and are based on utility functions. Henge's overall goal is to maximize the total system utility achieved by all jobs in the system. Henge is integrated into Apache Storm and we present experimental results using both production jobs from Yahoo! and real datasets from Twitter.},

We use a unified approach to load and fault management based on dynamic data replication and feedback-based scheduling. While replication provides scaling and high availability, feedback scheduling dynamically allocates tasks to commodity databases across workloads in response to peak loads or failure conditions thus providing quality of service.By augmenting the feedback loop with state awareness, we avoidoscillations in resource allocation. We investigate our transparent provisioning mechanisms in the database tier using the TPC-W e-commerce and the on-line auction Rubis benchmarks. We demonstrate that our techniques provide quality of service under load bursts and failure scenarios.},

abstract = {Deep learning workloads are common in today's production clusters due to the proliferation of deep learning driven AI services (e.g., speech recognition, machine translation). A deep learning training job is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Efficient resource scheduling is the key to the maximal performance of a deep learning cluster. Existing cluster schedulers are largely not tailored to deep learning jobs, and typically specifying a fixed amount of resources for each job, prohibiting high resource efficiency and job performance. This paper proposes Optimus, a customized job scheduler for deep learning clusters, which minimizes job training time based on online resource-performance models. Optimus uses online fitting to predict model convergence during training, and sets up performance models to accurately estimate training speed as a function of allocated resources in each job. Based on the models, a simple yet effective method is designed and used for dynamically allocating resources and placing deep learning tasks to minimize job completion time. We implement Optimus on top of Kubernetes, a cluster manager for container orchestration, and experiment on a deep learning cluster with 7 CPU servers and 6 GPU servers, running 9 training jobs using the MXNet framework. Results show that Optimus outperforms representative cluster schedulers by about 139% and 63% in terms of job completion time and makespan, respectively.},

abstract = {Tasks in modern data parallel clusters have highly diverse resource requirements, along CPU, memory, disk and network. Any of these resources may become bottlenecks and hence, the likelihood of wasting resources due to fragmentation is now larger. Today's schedulers do not explicitly reduce fragmentation. Worse, since they only allocate cores and memory, the resources that they ignore (disk and network) can be over-allocated leading to interference, failures and hogging of cores or memory that could have been used by other tasks. We present Tetris, a cluster scheduler that packs, i.e., matches multi-resource task requirements with resource availabilities of machines so as to increase cluster efficiency (makespan). Further, Tetris uses an analog of shortest-running-time-first to trade-off cluster efficiency for speeding up individual jobs. Tetris' packing heuristics seamlessly work alongside a large class of fairness policies. Trace-driven simulations and deployment of our prototype on a 250 node cluster shows median gains of 30% in job completion time while achieving nearly perfect fairness.},

business environments where customers expect guaranteed performance. To date, however,
these systems are not capable of providing guarantees on job latency because scheduling
policies are based on fair-sharing, and operators seek high cluster use through statistical
multiplexing and over-subscription. With Jockey, we provide latency SLOs for data
parallel jobs written in SCOPE. Jockey precomputes statistics using a simulator that
captures the job's complex internal dependencies, accurately and efficiently predicting
the remaining run time at different resource allocations and in different stages of
the job. Our control policy monitors a job's performance, and dynamically adjusts
resource allocation in the shared cluster in order to maximize the job's economic
utility while minimizing its impact on the rest of the cluster. In our experiments
in Microsoft's production Cosmos clusters, Jockey meets the specified job latency
SLOs and responds to changes in cluster conditions.},
