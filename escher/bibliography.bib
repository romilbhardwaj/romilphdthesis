abstract = {Evaluating the performance of large compute clusters requires benchmarks with representative workloads. At Google, performance benchmarks are used to obtain performance metrics such as task scheduling delays and machine resource utilizations to assess changes in application codes, machine configurations, and scheduling algorithms. Existing approaches to workload characterization for high performance computing and grids focus on task resource requirements for CPU, memory, disk, I/O, network, etc. Such resource requirements address how much resource is consumed by a task. However, in addition to resource requirements, Google workloads commonly include task placement constraints that determine which machine resources are consumed by tasks. Task placement constraints arise because of task dependencies such as those related to hardware architecture and kernel version.This paper develops methodologies for incorporating task placement constraints and machine properties into performance benchmarks of large compute clusters. Our studies of Google compute clusters show that constraints increase average task scheduling delays by a factor of 2 to 6, which often results in tens of minutes of additional task wait time. To understand why, we extend the concept of resource utilization to include constraints by introducing a new metric, the Utilization Multiplier (UM). UM is the ratio of the resource utilization seen by tasks with a constraint to the average utilization of the resource. UM provides a simple model of the performance impact of constraints in that task scheduling delays increase with UM. Last, we describe how to synthesize representative task constraints and machine properties, and how to incorporate this synthesis into existing performance benchmarks. Using synthetic task constraints and machine properties generated by our methodology, we accurately reproduce performance metrics for benchmarks of Google compute clusters with a discrepancy of only 13% in task scheduling delay and 5% in resource utilization.},

edition = {5th},
abstract = {Computer Networks, 5/e is appropriate for Computer Networking or Introduction to Networking courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, CIS, MIS, and Business Departments. Tanenbaum takes a structured approach to explaining how networks work from the inside out. He starts with an explanation of the physical layer of networking, computer hardware and transmission systems; then works his way up to network applications. Tanenbaum's in-depth application coverage includes email; the domain name system; the World Wide Web (both client- and server-side); and multimedia (including voice over IP, Internet radio video on demand, video conferencing, and streaming media. Each chapter follows a consistent approach: Tanenbaum presents key principles, then illustrates them utilizing real-world example networks that run through the entire bookthe Internet, and wireless networks, including Wireless LANs, broadband wireless and Bluetooth. The Fifth Edition includes a chapter devoted exclusively to network security. The textbook is supplemented by a Solutions Manual, as well as a Website containing PowerPoint slides, art in various forms, and other tools for instruction, including a protocol simulator whereby students can develop and test their own network protocols.}

abstract = {Naiad is a distributed system for executing data parallel, cyclic dataflow programs. It offers the high throughput of batch processors, the low latency of stream processors, and the ability to perform iterative and incremental computations. Although existing systems offer some of these features, applications that require all three have relied on multiple platforms, at the expense of efficiency, maintainability, and simplicity. Naiad resolves the complexities of combining these features in one framework.A new computational model, timely dataflow, underlies Naiad and captures opportunities for parallelism across a wide class of algorithms. This model enriches dataflow computation with timestamps that represent logical points in the computation and provide the basis for an efficient, lightweight coordination mechanism.We show that many powerful high-level programming models can be built on Naiad's low-level primitives, enabling such diverse tasks as streaming data analysis, iterative machine learning, and interactive graph mining. Naiad outperforms specialized systems in their target application domains, and its unique features enable the development of new high-performance applications.},

abstract = {Resource allocation is an integral, evolving part of many data center management problems such as virtual machine placement in data centers, network virtualization, and multi-path network routing. Since the problems are inherently NP-Hard, most existing systems use custom-designed heuristics to find a suitable solution. However, such heuristics are often rigid, making it difficult to extend them as requirements change.In this paper, we present a novel approach to resource allocation that permits the problem specification to evolve with ease. We have built Wrasse, a generic and extensible tool that cloud environments can use to solve their specific allocation problem. Wrasse provides a simple yet expressive specification language that captures a wide range of resource allocation problems. At the back-end, it leverages the power of GPUs to provide solutions to the allocation problems in a fast and timely manner. We show the extensibility of Wrasse by expressing several allocation problems in its specification language. Our experiments show that Wrasse's solution quality is as good as with heuristics, and sometimes even better, while maintaining good performance. In one case, Wrasse packed 71% more instances than a custom heuristic.},
