Recognizing a paradigm shift in the industry the Transaction Processing Performance Council has developed a new Decision Support benchmark, TPC-DS, expected to be released this year. From an ease of benchmarking perspective it is similar to past benchmarks. However, it adjusts for new technology and new approaches the industry has embarked on in recent years. This paper describes the main characteristics of TPC-DS, explains why some of the key decisions were made and which performance aspects of decision support system it measures.},

and larger degrees of parallelism to provide low latency. Scheduling highly parallel
jobs that complete in hundreds of milliseconds poses a major challenge for task schedulers,
which will need to schedule millions of tasks per second on appropriate machines while
offering millisecond-level latency and high availability. We demonstrate that a decentralized,
randomized sampling approach provides near-optimal performance while avoiding the
throughput and availability limitations of a centralized design. We implement and
deploy our scheduler, Sparrow, on a 110-machine cluster and demonstrate that Sparrow
performs within 12% of an ideal scheduler.},

abstract = {Data processing frameworks such as MapReduce [8] and Dryad [11] are used today in
business environments where customers expect guaranteed performance. To date, however,
these systems are not capable of providing guarantees on job latency because scheduling
policies are based on fair-sharing, and operators seek high cluster use through statistical
multiplexing and over-subscription. With Jockey, we provide latency SLOs for data
parallel jobs written in SCOPE. Jockey precomputes statistics using a simulator that
captures the job's complex internal dependencies, accurately and efficiently predicting
the remaining run time at different resource allocations and in different stages of
the job. Our control policy monitors a job's performance, and dynamically adjusts
resource allocation in the shared cluster in order to maximize the job's economic
utility while minimizing its impact on the rest of the cluster. In our experiments
in Microsoft's production Cosmos clusters, Jockey meets the specified job latency
SLOs and responds to changes in cluster conditions.},

abstract = {Cloud services have recently started undergoing a major shift from monolithic applications,
to graphs of hundreds or thousands of loosely-coupled microservices. Microservices
fundamentally change a lot of assumptions current cloud systems are designed with,
and present both opportunities and challenges when optimizing for quality of service
(QoS) and cloud utilization.In this paper we explore the implications microservices
have across the cloud system stack. We first present DeathStarBench, a novel, open-source
benchmark suite built with microservices that is representative of large end-to-end
services, modular and extensible. DeathStarBench includes a social network, a media
service, an e-commerce site, a banking system, and IoT applications for coordination
control of UAV swarms. We then use DeathStarBench to study the architectural characteristics
of microservices, their implications in networking and operating systems, their challenges
with respect to cluster management, and their trade-offs in terms of application design
and programming frameworks. Finally, we explore the tail at scale effects of microservices
in real deployments with hundreds of users, and highlight the increased pressure they
put on performance predictability.},

abstract = {To better understand the challenges in developing effective cloud-based resource schedulers, we analyze the first publicly available trace data from a sizable multi-purpose cluster. The most notable workload characteristic is heterogeneity: in resource types (e.g., cores:RAM per machine) and their usage (e.g., duration and resources needed). Such heterogeneity reduces the effectiveness of traditional slot- and core-based scheduling. Furthermore, some tasks are constrained as to the kind of machine types they can use, increasing the complexity of resource assignment and complicating task migration. The workload is also highly dynamic, varying over time and most workload features, and is driven by many short jobs that demand quick scheduling decisions. While few simplifying assumptions apply, we find that many longer-running jobs have relatively stable resource utilizations, which can help adaptive resource schedulers.},

We prove this using a discrete-time model of a single resource, shared among a number of users with heterogeneous Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) controls. AIMD has been implemented in the congestion avoidance mechanism of Internet's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and beyond its simplicity it has been proved extremely efficient and robust. We show how AIMD can be parametrized in order to allow the scaling of user allocations according to a given set of weights. We also analyze the effects of different parameter choices on the performance and the oscillating behaviour of the system. Our analysis is supported by simulations and the results provide useful insights to the performance and the properties of distributed resource sharing.},

abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets that is amenable to a broad variety of real-world tasks. Users specify the computation in terms of a map and a reduce function, and the underlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the computation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles machine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks. Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.},

abstract = {We present Henge, a system to support intent-based multi-tenancy in modern distributed stream processing systems. Henge supports multi-tenancy as a first-class citizen: everyone in an organization can now submit their stream processing jobs to a single, shared, consolidated cluster. Secondly, Henge allows each job to specify its own intents (i.e., requirements) as a Service Level Objective (SLO) that captures latency and/or throughput needs. In such an intent-driven multi-tenant cluster, the Henge scheduler adapts continually to meet jobs' respective SLOs in spite of limited cluster resources, and under dynamically varying workloads. SLOs are soft and are based on utility functions. Henge's overall goal is to maximize the total system utility achieved by all jobs in the system. Henge is integrated into Apache Storm and we present experimental results using both production jobs from Yahoo! and real datasets from Twitter.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a self-configuring architecture for scaling the database tier of dynamic content web servers. We use a unified approach to load and fault management based on dynamic data replication and feedback-based scheduling. While replication provides scaling and high availability, feedback scheduling dynamically allocates tasks to commodity databases across workloads in response to peak loads or failure conditions thus providing quality of service.By augmenting the feedback loop with state awareness, we avoidoscillations in resource allocation. We investigate our transparent provisioning mechanisms in the database tier using the TPC-W e-commerce and the on-line auction Rubis benchmarks. We demonstrate that our techniques provide quality of service under load bursts and failure scenarios.},
